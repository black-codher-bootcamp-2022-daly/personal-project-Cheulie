      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h1 style= color:aquamarine >About Us</h1>
    <p style= font:ariel>Hello there, my name is Charlene. During the height of first wave with all its associated uncertainty, being locked down and the untimely passing of my father due to this terrible virus, I needed to find ways of keeping my sanity. 
      After successfully putting my hands to gardening, DIY, clothes-making and upholstery I found a niche for my creativity in baking and decorating and this where @ohbaby.cakeslondon was born. <br><br>
      My husband bought me a <a href="https://www.KitchenAid.co.uk">KitchenAid</a>; from this point I just couldnâ€™t stop making and decorating. I threw my energy and passion into creating meaningful birthday cake designs for all family and close friends. <br><br>
      From my iconic Sonic the hedgehog cake to Hey Duggee, Spiderman and most recent ones for a Cricket Fanatic to a show stopping Halloween competition cake! <br><br>
      I love baking, but more importantly I love creating art in the form of a sweet treat - a feast for both the eyes and mouth!<br><br>
      For me, baking is the epitome of my very own Phoenix rising through the ashes. <br>
      Check out my page on IG to see my cake journey, and to marvel at my @ohbaby.cakeslondon</p>
